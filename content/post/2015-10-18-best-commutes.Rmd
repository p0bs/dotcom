A friend at work was recently hoping to buy his first house and asked me where to look. "That depends on what you need", I said, like a typical consultant. But it got me thinking. 

Knowing the criteria in question, I had some general views, but they didn't even convince me. So I turned to data. Fortunately, I could scrape data on the criteria I sought for all English districts:

  * Commuting time by car (weight of 15) -- I could've used ggmap but had an old copy of Microsoft MapPoint, which proved easier 
  
  * Average age of the district's residents (weight of 1) -- Like the remaining criteria, this data came from the ONS site 
  
  * Typical cost of housing in the district (weight of 6)
  
  * Standardised crime statistics for the district (weight of 6)
  
  * Educational achievement in the district (weight of 6)
  
  * Level of deprivation in the district (weight of 3)

I then pulled all this together into a weighted desirability score and mapped it. And, thinking optimistically, it must have helped my friend, as he ended-up buying a property in district rated as highly desirable.

Here are the results:

```{r thecodec, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(leaflet)
library(widgetframe)
    
ScoredAreas1a <- read_csv(
  "data/ScoredAreas1a.csv", 
  col_types = c("iicddldddddidddddd"))
  
Areas1.df <- read_csv(
  "data/Areas1df.csv", 
  col_types = c("iicddilic"))
  
TopAreas <- ScoredAreas1a %>%
  mutate(score = -1*((15*z.time) + 
                       (1*z.age) + 
                       (6*z.expense) + 
                       (6*z.crime) + 
                       (6*z.flunkers) + 
                       (3*z.deprived))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(score), id) %>% 
  left_join(Areas1.df, by="id") %>%
  rename(lng=long)
  
colnames(TopAreas)[24] <- "Xorder"
  
LngLat1 <- TopAreas %>% 
  arrange(desc(score), id, Xorder) %>% 
  select(lng, lat, id, Xorder, score) %>% 
  mutate(Nid0a = substring(id, 1, 1),
         Nid0b = as.numeric(substring(id, 2))
         )
  
LngLat1a1 <- substring(LngLat1$id, 1, 1)
LngLat1a2 <- substring(LngLat1$id, 2)
Nid <- as.numeric(LngLat1a2)
Nid1 <- unique(Nid)
Nid1 <- Nid1 + 0.5
  
LngLat2 <- LngLat1 %>% 
  select(lng, lat, score, Nid0b)
  
lLngLat3 <- length(Nid1)
  
LngLat3a <- rep(NA, lLngLat3)
LngLat3b <- rep(NA, lLngLat3)
LngLat3c <- rep(NA, lLngLat3)
  
LngLat3 <- cbind(LngLat3a, LngLat3b, LngLat3c, Nid1)
colnames(LngLat3) <- c("lng", "lat", "score", "Nid0b")
  
LngLat4 <- rbind(LngLat2, LngLat3)
  
LngLat4b <- LngLat4 %>% 
  arrange(Nid0b) 
  
LngLat5 <- LngLat4b %>% 
  select(lng, lat)
  
LngLat <- as.matrix(LngLat5, ncol=2)
  
Score1 <- LngLat4b %>% 
  select(Nid0b, score) %>% 
  distinct()
  
Score1 <- Score1[complete.cases(Score1),]
Score1 <- as.matrix(Score1, ncol=2)
Score1 <- as.data.frame(Score1)
  
pal <- colorQuantile("YlOrRd", NULL, n = 16)
  
l <- leaflet(LngLat) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
  setView(lng = -0.3, lat = 51.3, zoom = 8) %>% 
  addPolygons(fillColor = pal(Score1$score), 
              popup = paste("Overall score: ", 
                            round(Score1$score,2)),
              weight = 1,
              color = "grey",
              opacity = 0.7,
              smoothFactor = 0.5)  %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, 
            values = Score1$score,
            title = "Desirability",
            labFormat = labelFormat(),
            opacity = 1)
  
frameWidget(l, height = 400)
```

<br></br>

I've also built this [Shiny app](http://robin.shinyapps.io/location) to add interaction to this map, enabling users to alter the weights and select only coastal regions, should they wish. 

And here's the code for the map above:

```{r thecodec, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
```
