With all the teams just having three games remaining, the Premier League is still so close. And so is PremPredict. The difference this year, though, is that the standard at the top of the league is fantastic -- in both competitions.

For that reason, the congratulations go to *Roger Gathercole*, who is leading from *Luke* and *Neil* ... but only just.

### Latest standings

Here's what you really want to know, though ...

```{r thecode191, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(premPredictor)
player_data <- get_player_data("https://www.dropbox.com/s/uin6zk4w5cyk2m1/PremPredict-18-19.csv")
get_latest_standings(data_input = player_data)
```

</br>

I'll be in touch before the final game, so stay tuned. 

All the best ...

### Appendix

For completeness, here's the code that I used to calculate what's above, using [this package](https://github.com/p0bs/premPredictor).

```{r showthecode191, ref.label='thecode191', eval=FALSE}
```
