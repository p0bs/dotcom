Before the big game tonight -- which won't really alter the PremPredict leaderboard -- the podium places are unchanged from my last update. 

For that reason, the congratulations still go to *Luke Finnis*. He's still leading from *Roger* and *Neil*, albeit with a better score. As for Neil, he must have mixed feelings, as he almost always puts heart above head and predicts Liverpool to win ... except for this year.

### Latest standings

Here's what you really want to know, though ...

```{r thecode191, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(premPredictor)

player_data <- get_player_data("https://www.dropbox.com/s/uin6zk4w5cyk2m1/PremPredict-18-19.csv")
  
get_latest_standings(data_input = player_data)
```

<p style="height: .5em;">&nbsp;</p>

Oh, and my folks might not want to look at the lower half of the table!

<p style="height: .5em;">&nbsp;</p>

I'll be in touch in a month or two with more standings, so stay tuned. 

All the best and happy 2019 ...

### Appendix

For completeness, here's the code that I used to calculate what's above.

```{r showthecode191, ref.label='thecode191', eval=FALSE}
```
