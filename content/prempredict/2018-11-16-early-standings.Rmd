With a third of the season gone, early congratulations go to *Luke Finnis*. He's leading with a really good score, but doesn't have City to win, so there's still a chance for *Roger*, *Neil* and others.

### Latest standings

Here's what you really want to know, though ...

```{r thecode191, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(DT)
library(ggridges)
library(premPredictor)
library(widgetframe)

player_data <- get_player_data("https://www.dropbox.com/s/uin6zk4w5cyk2m1/PremPredict-18-19.csv")
   
get_latest_standings(data_input = player_data)
```

</br>

I'll be in touch in a month or two with more standings, so stay tuned. 

All the best ...

### Appendix

For completeness (and reproducibility), here's the code that I used to calculate what's above.

```{r showthecode191, ref.label='thecode191', eval=FALSE}
```

And [here are your team-by-team predictions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KgzlXAdcH5dwFllIU0Nktq-_QTwWwBuj76Di-UYQbtA/edit?usp=sharing), alongside the [latest team standings](http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table).
